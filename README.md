# ThereIsNoGame
A full recreation of There Is No Game made in tkinter, with some changes

Made in about 2 weeks.
Very poorly made, as TKinter is not a very good game engine.
Mostly used to test the extents of TKinter.
Pong was replaced with a simple top down shooter to save time.
Please install the two fonts located within the file.
